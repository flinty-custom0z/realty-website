# District Selection Feature Implementation

This enhancement adds the ability to select districts from a dropdown and add new districts when creating/editing listings.

## Overview

- Added a new `District` model in Prisma schema
- Updated the district field in the listing form to use a select dropdown
- Added ability to create a new district if it's not in the list
- Created an API endpoint for district management
- Developed a migration script to populate the district table from existing data

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Database Changes

1. Add the `District` model to the Prisma schema
2. Update the `Listing` model to add a relationship to the District model
3. Run the Prisma migration: `npx prisma migrate dev --name add_district_model`

### 2. API Implementation

1. Update or create the `/api/districts` endpoint with:
   - GET - to list all districts
   - POST - to create new districts (admin-only)
2. Update the listing validator to handle the new district relationship

### 3. UI Implementation

1. Update the listing creation/editing form to:
   - Display a dropdown of existing districts
   - Include an option to add a new district
   - Handle creating a new district and selecting it

### 4. Data Migration

1. Run the district population script to migrate existing data:
   `npx ts-node scripts/populate-districts.ts`

## Usage

When creating or editing a listing, the district dropdown now shows all existing districts. If the needed district is not in the list, select the "Add new district" option to create it on the fly.

## Future Enhancements

1. District management interface in the admin panel
2. Search/filtering by district on the frontend
3. Remove the old district field once all data is migrated
