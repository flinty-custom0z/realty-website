## Land Plots (Земельные участки)
"Aerial view of pristine, undeveloped land with gentle rolling terrain. Mix of open meadows and scattered trees with clean horizon line. Natural green and earth tones, photographed in soft evening light. Minimalist composition with balanced negative space for text overlay."

## Commercial Properties (Коммерция)
