# Property Type Implementation

This document provides details about the property type implementation in the real estate application.

## Implementation Status

The property type system has been successfully implemented with the following components:

1. **Database Schema**:
   - Created `PropertyType` model in Prisma schema
   - Added relationship between `Listing` and `PropertyType`
   - Removed the `title` field from `Listing`
   - Added migration scripts

2. **API Endpoints**:
   - `/api/property-types` - Get all property types
   - `/api/property-types/[id]` - Get a specific property type
   - `/api/admin/property-types` - Admin endpoints for CRUD operations

3. **Service Layer**:
   - Updated `ListingService` to work with property types
   - Added property type filters

## Testing the Implementation

### 1. Running Prisma Studio

To verify the database schema is working correctly:

```bash
npx prisma studio
```

You should be able to view and edit PropertyType records.

### 2. Testing the Admin Interface

1. Log into the admin interface
2. Create a new listing - You should see a dropdown for property types based on the selected category
3. Edit an existing listing - Verify that the property type is correctly displayed and editable
4. View the listings table - The property type should be displayed instead of the previous title field

### 3. Testing the Public Interface

1. Visit the search page
2. Check that the property type filter works correctly
3. View individual listings - Property type should be displayed instead of title

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### SQL Error: "column must appear in the GROUP BY clause"

If you encounter this error, it's likely related to how Prisma is generating the SQL query for aggregations. The fixes include:

1. Ensuring proper structure in includes/selects
2. Avoiding mixing GROUP BY with non-aggregated fields

### Prisma Error: "Invalid invocation"

This could happen if the Prisma client hasn't been regenerated:

```bash
npx prisma generate
```

### Missing Property Types in UI

If property types are not appearing in the UI:

1. Check the database to ensure they exist
2. Verify API endpoints are returning data correctly
3. Check frontend components are correctly passing type information

## Remaining Tasks

- Update any remaining references to 'title' in the codebase
- Add comprehensive test coverage for property type functionality
- Optimize database queries for property type filtering
